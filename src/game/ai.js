/**
 * The bots.
 *
 * They run inside the simulation rather than beside it: `botInput` returns the
 * same three fields a person's mouse and keyboard produce, and the simulation
 * cannot tell which is which. That is not tidiness for its own sake - in
 * lockstep every machine runs every bot, so a bot that consulted anything but
 * the state (the clock, Math.random, how fast this particular laptop is) would
 * turn left here and right there and the match would come apart.
 *
 * A bot does four things, in this order, and they are deliberately separate:
 *
 *   who am I fighting   - the nearest enemy it can actually see
 *   where am I going    - a path through nav.js to an item, a flag or a fight
 *   where am I looking  - the enemy, led by its own velocity, plus an error
 *   what am I pressing  - the two buttons nearest the way it wants to move
 *
 * The difference between Rookie and Brutal is four numbers in SKILLS and nothing
 * else: how big the aim error is, how long it takes to notice you, how well it
 * leads a moving target, and how single-minded it is about picking things up.
 * There is no bot that sees through walls and no bot that is given free damage.
