/**
 * The match, as data.
 *
 * Same contract as the rest of the series: one plain object holding everything
 * the game needs, no DOM, no clock, and no randomness that does not come out of
 * `state.rng`. Four machines given the same state and the same buttons must
 * reach the same score, which is what makes the netcode possible and, more
 * usefully day to day, makes the whole thing testable without a browser.
 *
 * The two things in here that are not numbers are `state.map` and `state.world`,
 * and both are safe: they are built from the map's key by loadMap() and
 * buildWorld(), which are pure and cached, so every machine has the identical
 * arena down to the last box.
